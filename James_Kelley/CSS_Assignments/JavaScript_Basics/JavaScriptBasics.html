	      <h3>JavaScript Basics</h3>
	      	<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small 
	      	and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. J avaScript lives inside a host
					environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over 
					them.

						<ul>
							<li><a class="link" href="variable declaration">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, 
							a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="purple">var x;</span>

							</li>
							<li><a class="link" href="variable assignment">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our
							variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.	</span class="purple">var x = 10;</span>
							</li>
							<li><a class="link" href="data types">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types
							that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="purple">true</span> or  <span class="purple">false</span> null -  <span class="purple">null</span> aka nothing; Number -  <span class="purple">42</span> or  <span class="purple">3.14159;</span> String -  <span class="purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks! ;</span>
							Array - <span class="purple">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo']</span>; and Object - <span class="purple">{first_name: 'Jane", last_name: 'Doe'</span>							
							</li>
							<li><a class="link" href="conditonals">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on
							values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following
							conditional statements:  <span class="purple">if</span> a speciﬁed condition is true, do this code in our code block;  <span class="purple">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the ﬁrst
							condition is false;  <span class="purple">else</span> we execute this block of code;
							</li>
							<li><a class="link" href="loops">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat
							an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!
							</li>
							<li><a class="link" href="function">Function</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of 
							instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, ﬁrst we 
							screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We ﬁnished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more
							tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
